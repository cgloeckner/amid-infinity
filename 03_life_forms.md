# Life Forms of Amid Infinity

## HUMAN >> +2 Stat/Effort points

The humble origin of today's technology is located in the cradle of humanity. There are people as you and I, versatile but also complex. Some people are a gain to humanity, others are a puzzle piece of its decay. Unknowing of larger forces and entities, humanity lives its life in a sphere of illusion.

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. 

from [*The Call of Cthulhu*](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx) (by H. P. Lovecraft, 1926)
