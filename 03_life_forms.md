# Life Forms

## HUMAN

The humble origin of today's technology is located in the cradle of humanity.

Versatile but also complex, there are people as you and I. Some people are a gain to humanity, others are a puzzle piece of its decay. But humanity lives its life in a sphere of illusion, unknowing of larger forces and entities

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. 

from [*The Call of Cthulhu*](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx) (by H. P. Lovecraft, 1926)
