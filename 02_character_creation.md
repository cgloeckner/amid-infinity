# Character Creation

Creating a character in **Amid Infinity** follows the same rules as ICME does.

1. Choose your LIFE FORM and TYPE
2. Write a one-line story
3. Assign 6 STATS and 4 EFFORT
4. Grab a STARTER LOOT and 4 COMMON LOOT

**Amid Infinity** can be played in a setting, but works great for Lovecraft's era of the 1920s. If this does not fit 
your game, feel free to modify or even skip the changes ahead.

The options below are kept free from mechanics by design. Make them fit your style or even go full narrative with them.

## Experience

All characters are HUMAN and no heroes. Instead, replace your LIFE FORM with EXPERIENCE. An EXPERIENCE describes a 
detail from your past and yields a benefit.
