# Character Creation

Creating a character in **Amid Infinity** follows the same rules as ICME does.
1. Choose your LIFE FORM and TYPE
3. Write a one-line story
4. Assign 6 STATS and 4 EFFORT
5. Grab a STARTER LOOT and 4 COMMON LOOT

**Amid Infinity** can be played in an setting, but works great for Lovecraft's era of the 1920s. If this does not fit your game, feel free to modify or even skip the changes ahead.

The options below are kept free from mechanics by design. Make them fit your style or even go full narrative with them.

## Experience

All characters are HUMAN and no heroes. Instead, replace your LIFE FORM with EXPERIENCE. An EXPERIENCE describes a detail from your past and yields a benefit.

**D10 EXPERIENCES** *(Pick or roll once)*
|	  |Tag				|Description|
|-----|---				|---|
|  1. | RICH 			| Money is not an issue at all. |
|  2. | INSIGHT 			| You have seen things nobody is meant to see. |
|  3. | VIOLENCE 		| Violence has hardened you. |
|  4. | FAITHFUL 		| Your faith in the good helps you to continue. |
|  5. | LUCK 			| Luck is on your side! |
|  6. | HANDICAP 		| A permanent issue disables you but makes you better somehow. |
|  7. | ALL HOPE IS GONE | Isolation and despair has hardened you. |
|  8. | LOSS 			| The loss of beloved people made you stronger. |
|  9. |	COMMITMENT		| You have dedicated yourself to job, sports, science, hobby or the like. |
| 10. |	MULTILINGUAL	| You were raised by multilingual parents or have spent quite some time abroad. |

**Example mechanics:**
- Characters with INSIGHT may roll EASY on rituals they performed earlier.
- A HANDICAPPED character may receive additional +2 on DEX but cannot tell the difference between blue and green.

## Profession

Instead of picking a TYPE, a PROFESSION roughly describes fields of expertise in which you excell. The table below is a starting point that outlines rough ideas.

**D6 PROFESSIONS** *(Pick or roll once)*
|	 |Category			|Example professions|
|----|---				|---|
| 1. | ACADEMIC 		| Tutor, student, scientist, librarian, assistent, ... |
| 2. | ARTIST 			| Author, musician, painter, actor, photographer, magician or the like |
| 3. | PUBLIC FIGURE 	| Rich person, journalist, priest, lawyer, teacher, salesman, ... |
| 4. | CRAFTSMAN 		| Electricians, plumbers, mechanics, janitor, tailor, ... |
| 5. | SLEUTH 			| Police officer, private eye, intelligence officer or the like |
| 6. | MEDICINE 		| Doctor, therapist, nurse, pharmacist, veterinary or similar |

**Example mechanics:**
- Distract guards may be EASY for a THEATER ACTOR.
- Sneaking on a suspect may be EASY for a PRIVATE EYE.

## Starter Loot

Since the variety of characters is too vast, STARTER LOOT comes in categories and allow you build upon those ideas to fit your character concept.

**D4 STARTER LOOT** *(Pick or roll once)*
|	 |Category		|Example LOOT|
|----|---			|---|
| 1. | FIRST AID	| Be it badages, sedatives or anything else |
| 2. | TOOL 		| Lock picks or similar |
| 3. | WEAPON 		| Knife, brass knuckles or such |
| 4. | GUN 			| Revolver, rifle or the like... but why? |

**Example mechanics:**
- FIRST AID heals TOOL effort after a successful INT/WIS roll.
- A REVOLVER has 6 bullets. Reloading introduces a SPELL BURN timer.

## Common Loot

**D8 COMMON LOOT** *(Pick or roll up to three times)*
|     |Category			|Ideas to build upon|
|-----|---				|---|
|  1. | DRUGS 			| Cigaretts, alcohol, coffee in thermos or such |
|  2. | HEIRLOOM 		| You never give it away! But who gave it to you? |
|  3. | TOY 			| Marbles, playing cards or similar |
|  4. | LIGHT SOURCE 	| Flashlight, matches, lantern or else |
|  5. | DOCUMENTATION 	| Notepad, folding camera, dictaphone or similar |
|  6. | ORIENTATION 	| Compass, maps or such things |
|  7. | STURDY CLOTHES 	| Jacket, overall or the like that grants some DEFENSE |
|  8. | SURVIVAL KIT 	| Equipped for the wilderness |

**Example mechanics:**
- DRUGS may allow for EASY RECOVERY rolls.
- LIGHT SOURCES may lower the TARGET in dark areas.

## Backpack

You carry quite a lot more than you have written in your inventory. Use your TURN to invent an ITEM. Write it down as a piece of LOOT for future use.

## Milestone Options

Up to the GM's discretion, characters will gain MILESTONES, such as:
- Gain a STAT or EFFORT point
- Cure a WOUND or INSANITY (see Rule Modifications on [Sanity](03_rule_mods.md#Sanity))
