# Character Creation

Creating a character in **Amid Infinity** follows the same rules as ICME does.

1. Choose your LIFE FORM and TYPE
2. Write a one-line story
3. Assign 6 STATS and 4 EFFORT
4. Grab a STARTER LOOT and 4 COMMON LOOT

**Amid Infinity** can be played in a setting, but works great for Lovecraft's era of the 1920s. Hence loot and other things are kept era-neutral. If things do not fit your game, feel free to modify or even skip the changes ahead.

# Profession and Skills

All characters are HUMAN and no heroes. Instead of picking a LIFEFORM and TYPE, each character is built from a PROFESSION and a set of SKILLS. Trained Skills are EASY, expert skills are ALWAYS EASY (i.e. ignoring HARD).
