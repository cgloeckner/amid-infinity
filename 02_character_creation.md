# Character Creation

Follow the Steps from **ICME**
1. **Who and what are you**: Consider *Human* Life Form and a *Regular Man/Women* (see below) but don't forget your one-line story.
2. **Core Stats**: See ICME p. 25
3. **Boost Effort Types** See ICME p. 26
4. **Locate Status Info** See ICME p. 27 and consider the twist for *Regular Man/Women*
5. **Record Abilities** These come in form of SKILLS, see *Regular Man/Women*
6. **Record Augments** Probably unused for most eras, but in a modern setting a character could have a prothesis
7. **Get Loot!** See ICME p. 29
