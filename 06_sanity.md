# Sanity

## Sanity Damage

As ICME purposes:

> All sane characters start with 1 HEART of SANITY

(see ICME p. 112)

Sanity damage can be rolled using an EFFORT CATEGORY. 

| CATEGORY  | Description           | Example |
|:---------:|:---------------------:|---------|
| 1         | minor                 | mostly for diminished SANITY damage |
| BASIC     | basic dread           | realize that it's not a dream after all |
| WEAPON    | violence              | witness a friend drop dying |
| GUN       | superior violence     | the woman's eyes burst blood red |
| MAGIC     | supernatural          | realize the shadowy figure has claws |
| ULTIMATE  | cosmic horrors        | witness Yog-Sothoth's arrival |

Allow to CHECK for SANITY using CHA. On success, lower the EFFORT category rolled by the GM according circumstances and quality of the roll (i.e. nat20).

Succeeding a SANITY CHECK against a supernatural thread as if it was HARD may lower the damage to only BASIC EFFORT.

NO RECOVERY: SANITY may be rega ined
from a MILESTONE relief but not in the MOMENT

> Return to 1 SANITY but gain an INSANITY TAG

Loosing larger amounts of SANITY is always dangers.

Push your players out of their comfort zone but not beyond what's fun.

## Breaking Point

SANITY symbolizes the individual distance to a character's breaking point. Reaching 0 SANITY causes the character to break down. The character behaves bonkers for a few ROUNDS as if DYING (see ICME p. 16).

**Breakdown examples**

*1d3*
- **FEAR**: Flee or hide from the cause. Now!
- **RAGE**: Violent 'til death, be it friend or foe.
- **GIVE UP**: You turn unconscious, catatonic, paralyzed or such.


## Calm down, buddy!

> Calm a broken down ally by talking and making a CHA roll.

(Modified *Don't die on me, man!* from ICME p. 17)

Once calmed, the character returns to 1 SANITY, regains cognitive but stays very close to the next breakdown.


## Insanity TAGs

If not calmed in time, the character succumbs to the breakdown permanently. That character either becomes an NPC or suffers INSANITY.

> Gain an INSANITY TAG immediately when losing 5 or more SANITY
