# Sanity

## Sanity Damage

As ICME purposes:

> All sane characters start with 1 HEART of SANITY

(see ICME p. 112)

Sanity damage can be rolled using an EFFORT CATEGORY. 

| CATEGORY  | Description           | Example |
|:---------:|:---------------------:|---------|
| 1         | minor                 | mostly for diminished SANITY damage |
| BASIC     | basic dread           | realize that it's not a dream after all |
| WEAPON    | violence              | witness a friend drop dying |
| GUN       | superior violence     | the woman's eyes burst blood red |
| MAGIC     | supernatural          | realize the shadowy figure has claws |
| ULTIMATE  | cosmic horrors        | witness Yog-Sothoth's arrival |

Allow to CHECK for SANITY using CHA. On success, lower the EFFORT category rolled by the GM according circumstances and quality of the roll (i.e. nat20).

Succeeding a SANITY CHECK against a supernatural thread as if it was HARD may lower the damage to only BASIC EFFORT.

NO RECOVERY: SANITY may be rega ined
from a MILESTONE relief but not in the MOMENT


## Breaking Point

SANITY symbolizes the individual distance to a character's breaking point. Reaching 0 SANITY causes the character to break down. The character behaves bonkers for a few ROUNDS as if DYING (see ICME p. 16).

**Breakdown examples**

| 1d6 | Tag         |Description                                 |
|:---:|:-----------:|:------------------------------------------:|
| 1-2 | **Fear**    | flee or hide from the cause                |
| 3-4 | **Rage**    | violent 'til death, against friend or foe  |
| 5-6 | **Give up** | unconscious, catatonic, paralyzed or such  |


## Calm down, buddy!

> Calm a broken down ally by talking and making a CHA roll.

(Modified *Don't die on me, man!* from ICME p. 17)

Once calmed, the character returns to 1 SANITY, regains cognitive but stays very close to the next breakdown.


## Insanity TAGs

If not calmed in time, the character succumbs to the breakdown. If the table is fine with playing bonkers PCs, the character returns to 1 SANITY but gains an INSANITY TAG as a long-term condition. The table below gives some inspiration that need to be worked out in the moment to make fit.
