# Players Guide

## Character Creation

Creating a character in **Amid Infinity** follows the same rules as ICME does.
1. Choose your LIFE FORM and TYPE
3. Write a one-line story
4. Assign STATS and EFFORT
5. Grab a STARTER LOOT and some COMMON LOOT

**Amid Infinity** can be played in an setting, but works great for Lovecraft's era of the 1920s. If this does not fit your game, feel free to modify or even skip the changes ahead.
