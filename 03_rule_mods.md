# Rule Modifications

## Sanity

- Characters will start with a HEART of sanity, symbolizing the individual distance to their breaking point.
- Mind-shattering circumstances will test a character's mental stability.
- A CHA roll is made to shrug or at least minimize of the effects.

## Sanity Loss

- Sanity damage comes in varieties such as a single point of damage or even rolling dice.
- Witessing minor yet unexplainable effects may only cause 1 or 1d4 damage, facing clearly supernatural or otherworldly phenomenons or creatures will take a more terrible toll or higher damage.
- Playing out sanity loss is supposed to left up to the individual player's discretion, taste and personal preference.

## Breakdown

- Reaching 0 sanity causes the character to break down. Use ICME's DYING mechanics here while the characters behaves bonkers.
- Other characters may attempt a don't-die-on-me using CHA to calm their buddy down.
- If successful, the character returns to 1 SAN and stays very close to his/her next break down.
- Else, apply INSANITY.
- BREAKDOWN TAGS are meant as short-term conditions, unless the character succumbs to it.

## Insanity

- Up to table, insane PCs either become NPCs instantly or receive an INSANITY TAG.
- It manifests insane behavior as a permanent condition but allows for continuation of play.
- Such PCs return to 1 SAN and stay on their edge.
- INSANITY TAGs are meant as long-term conditions and need to be worked out a bit to fit.
