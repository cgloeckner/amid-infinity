# Rule Modifications

## Sanity

Mind-shattering circumstances will test a character's mental stability. Physical and mental damage will both count 
towards regular HP. Each HEART will symbolize the character's distance to his/her personal breaking point.

- **Sanity check**
  - Roll INT/WIS/CHA based on circumstances
  - Sanity damage counts against the HEART
- **Breakdown**
  - dropping to 0 HP causes WOUND or INSANITY tag
  - each tag lowers MaxHP by 1
  - don't-die-on-me to stabilize broken down person
