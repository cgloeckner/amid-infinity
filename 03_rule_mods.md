# Rule Modifications

## Sanity

Mind-shattering circumstances will test a character's mental stability. Physical and mental damage will both count towards regular HP. Each HEART will symbolize the character's distance to his/her personal breaking point.

- **Sanity check**
	- Roll INT/WIS/CHA based on circumstances
	- Sanity damage counts against the HEART
- **Breakdown**
	- dropping to 0 HP causes WOUND or INSANITY tag
	- each tag lowers MaxHP by 1
	- don't-die-on-me to stabilize broken down person

## Luck

Everybody starts a session with a HERO COIN that symbolizes LUCK.

- **Putting luck to the test**
	- flip coin, announce head or tail
	- coin remains at player
- **No wasted luck**
	- coins are only consumed if a failed attempt succeeds with it

## Mythos Spells

Sinister rituals can be performed by those who are willed to plunge into the darkness.

- **Insight**
	- Roll INT to cast
	- add +1 per INSANITY tag
- **Failure**
	- suffer sanity damage
