# Scenario Seeds

Creating a horror scenario can sound intimidating, but can be quite some fun!

The following aspects are not meant to be hard ruls but to fuel your mind and to seed your game.

Each story needs a hook for the characters to get involved. Start with the mundane, just like a typical day.

No sane person would go into a house where somebody was murdered in. Or even if they do: If they discover what is 
about to be discovered, nobody with the right mind would stay there! Let confinement and isolation snap shut!

## Horror

Raise the stakes, make it about something big. Their lifes is a point to start at, but even better: everything should 
be at the stakes! Shatter the characters' world view. Crush their dreams. This works even better when you pick a 
deity or creature beforehand and work it in.
